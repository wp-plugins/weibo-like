== Description ==

Adds Sina Weibo Like button on your site. A must-have plugin if your site visitors are mainly from China.

使用微博「赞」按钮，将生成的代码放置到你的博客、网站或其它支持HTML的位置，让你的用户轻松表达态度。当用户在您的站点上某个网页点击了赞按钮后，同时会同步一条包含网页内容的动态信息到微博显示。

Open Graph plugin by @willnorris is included in this plugin with some modifications, if you're using Jetpack by WordPress.com, it's recommended to enable Publicize module, then the build-in Open Graph function will disabled and the most update-to-date Open Graph feature by Publicize module will be used.

本插件集成了 @willnorris 的 Open Graph 插件，如果您使用 Jetpack by WordPress.com，建议激活 Publicize 模块，此插件会检测 Publicize 模块，并禁用自带的 Open Graph 功能

You can add Like button anywhere by putting `<wb:like></wb:like>` in your posts, pages or widgets. You can get more information about Like button at [Sina Weibo offical documentation](http://open.weibo.com/widget/like.php).

您可以通过添加 `<wb:like></wb:like>` 在任意位置（文章、页面、小挂件等）来添加微博「赞」按钮。详细参数请访问 [新浪微博「赞」按钮文档](http://open.weibo.com/widget/like.php)。
